I'm [Cory](http://corygrunk.com/), and this is my photo blog. I like to take photos of things I encounter every day. I hope you enjoy them.

My favorite camera over the years has been my Lomo LC-A, but film is expensive and a pain in the ass (sorry, it is). I've used a bunch of digital cameras over the years but lately I've landed on the Ricoh GR. It feels kind of Lomo-ish, it's small, and the image quality is great.

I'm doing this blog to keep me posting photos and not letting them hide on my hard drive.
